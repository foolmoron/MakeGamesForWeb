A simple little platforming/collecting game to go with my talk: Making Games With Your Web Skills! https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cG0tYudPkluIJy1a11dnDw8t91kijz3BOmvEY0aL5O0/edit#slide=id.p

The code is intentionally as dumb and simple as possible, so you can follow along. Do not use this code as actual advice for making a web game.

## /B_canvas2d
